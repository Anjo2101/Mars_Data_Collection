# Data Collection Module
In this assignment, I used web scrapping to collect data from various websites to conduct analysis.

# Visiting and Scrapping the Mars News Site Website

I used automated browsing to visit the Mars news site to inspect the page using Chrome DevTools and identified which elements to scrape. After that I created a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.

# Storing the Results

After extracting the titles and preview text of the news articles that I scrapped, I stored the scrapping results in Python data structures.

# Visiting and Scrapping the Mars Temperature Data Site

I used automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site to inspect the page using Chrome Dev Tools and identified which elements to scrape. After that I created a Beautiful Soup object to scrap the data in the HTML table.

# Storing the Results

After extracting the scraped data, I assembled it into a Pandas DataFrame.

# Preparing the Data for Analysis

After getting the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame, I examined the data types that are currently associated with each column. When appropriate, I converted the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.

# Data Analysis

After preparing the data for analysis, I then analyzed the dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions about the data (liated below):

# Data Analysis (Continued)

I also used Matplotlib to make multiple charts and plots for each piece of analyzed data for insight and thorough data visualization, example of one of those tables below:
